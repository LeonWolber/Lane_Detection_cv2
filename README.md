# Lane_detection_cv2
In this project I am working on Object detection and Lane detection for dashcam videos.

Applying HoughLines and certain transformations led to the following lane detection:

Afterwards, I started to incorporate the object detection:

Also, for streaming it works somewhat, but there is a lot of work left to do. (Remove color-difference, make the entire functionality more stable and less prone to errors)
